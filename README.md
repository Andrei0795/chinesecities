# Chinese Cities Github Project

An app I have developed in a few days to help myself and other fellow students discover new places in some chinese cities.

China is an amazing country and I was lucky enough to visit it with a University of Manchester programme called Study China. I learnt Chinese, Chinese culture and interracted with people in the Business and IT sector. This app shows 4 main attractions in each important city I have visited (Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou). You can use a table view to search but also use the map to view where they are.

Please note the images are taken by me and reusing them is not allowed.
